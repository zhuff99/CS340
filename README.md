How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

Focusing on creating good modular code from the very beggining is the best way to achieve this. Because my CRUD file was built modularly I was able to use it throughout this entire course without  having to edit it a single time. 


How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

One step at a time. For example in this project because I had already finished the table and the map locations all I had to do
was add the buttons and the pie chart. I focused on the buttons first and then when to working on the pie chart last. 


What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

Computer scientists work on everything that related to software. From the front-end to the back end. They can help companies
like Grazioso Salvare produce a website that is enjoyable to look at and easy to manipulate for greater UX.
